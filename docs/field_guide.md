# Field Guide (QField)

Simple, offline-first workflow for surveying wells in Oklahoma.

## Before heading out
- Open QField on the iPad/iPhone
- Sync the project from QFieldCloud and download for offline use
- App opens directly to Oklahoma with all wells visible

## Understanding the map symbols
- **STFD wells (priority)**: Map pins in blue (gas), orange (oil), purple (other)
- **Orphan wells (baseline)**: Circles in blue (gas), orange (oil), purple (other)  
- **Basemaps**: Street view and satellite imagery both available
- **All symbols visible**: No need to toggle layers on/off

## Well survey workflow (3 steps)

### Step 1: Navigate & Select
- Use GPS and map to locate target well
- Tap the well symbol (pin or circle) on map
- Form opens immediately

### Step 2: Record findings
Form shows well context at top:
- Well ID (API number)
- Source (STFD/ORPHAN)
- Well name and operator

Use big buttons to record your findings:
- **Well physically exists?**  No / Yes  
- **Small leak detected?** No / Yes
- **Viable for plugging?** No / Yes

### Step 3: Save & continue
- Tap Save (checkmark)
- System automatically marks well as visited with timestamp
- Returns to map for next well

## Navigation & team coordination
From any well form:
- **"Open in Google Maps"** → Get turn-by-turn directions
- **"Share via WhatsApp"** → Send location to team
- **"Apple Maps"** → Alternative navigation option

## Working offline
- Complete survey workflow works without cell/wifi
- Collect data for dozens of wells offline
- Maps and forms cached locally
- Sync when you return to connectivity

## End of day sync
- When back online, tap sync in QField
- All collected data uploads automatically
- Updated info available immediately in QFieldCloud
- Conflicts rare with single surveyor workflow

## Tips for efficiency
- Survey wells in logical geographic clusters
- Use satellite view to verify access routes
- "Unknown" is safer than guessing - be conservative
- Save frequently to avoid data loss
